DEMO

In order for the demo to work, Microsoft's DirectX SDK (June 2010) needs to be installed.

To view the game demo, go in the demo folder and double-click the executable file.
Altering or removing any of the other files in the demo folder may cause the game to refuse to load.


INSTRUCTIONS

Navigate through the menu with the up and down key.

For game instructions, select instructions in the menu (using up or down) then navigate left or right according to the arrow icon visible on the screen using the left or right arrow.

Mouse click and mouvements aren't enabled.
